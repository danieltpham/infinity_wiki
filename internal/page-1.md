# Brevo

### Overview

Brevo, formerly SendInBlue, is a digital marketing platform providing tools for email and SMS marketing, chat, CRM, and automation. It helps businesses manage campaigns, track performance, and boost customer engagement across all sizes.

We're currently using Brevo for:

* <mark style="color:red;">**Designing & sending digital email marketing (mass campaign)**</mark>
* Managing partial CRM databases, including geographical segmentation and purchasing pattern
* Sending direct email to customer via programming code

The first dot point is the one that is most important for the Marketing team, as the other 2 are managed automatically via the backend systems.

### Important points

<details>

<summary>Keep track of # of emails</summary>

We only have a limited number of emails per month. With our database size, we easily cross the threshold after 1 single campaign to the whole database, so be smart with the email budget.

And watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRkB1Saksk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRkB1Saksk)

Here are some examples on how to use segments & filters. Use a combination of these to narrow down your target recipients. The maximum target per location should only be \~8k.
